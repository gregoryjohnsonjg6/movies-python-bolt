This example application demonstrates how easy it is to get started with http://neo4j.com/developer[Neo4j] in Python.

It is a very simple web application that uses our Movie graph dataset to provide a search with listing, a detail view and a graph visualization.

=== The Stack

These are the components of our Web Application:

* Application Type:         Python-Web Application
* Web framework:            https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/[Flask] (Micro-Webframework)
* Neo4j Database Connector: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver[Neo4j Python Driver] for Cypher https://neo4j.com/developer/python[Docs]
* Database:                 Neo4j-Server (4.x) with multi-database
* Frontend:                 jquery, bootstrap, https://d3js.org/[d3.js]

Provision a database quickly with https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=movies[Neo4j Sandbox] or https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/[Neo4j Aura].

=== Setup

First get yourself setup with link:http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/[virtualenv] so we don't break any other Python stuff you have on your machine. After you've got that installed let's setup an environment for our app:

[source]
----
virtualenv neo4j-movies
source neo4j-movies/bin/activate
----

The next step is to install the dependencies for the app with pip (or pip3 for python3):

[source]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

=== Run locally

Start your local Neo4j Server (http://neo4j.com/download[Download & Install]), open the http://localhost:7474[Neo4j Browser]. 
Then install the Movies data-set with `:play movies`, click the statement, and hit the triangular "Run" button.

And finally let's start up a Flask web server:

[source]
----
python movies.py
# or python3 movies.py


Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/
----

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and you should see your first Neo4j application
